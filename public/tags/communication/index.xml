&lt;p&gt;Beyond Silence: The Rise of Communication in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
Imagine a team of robots on a mission: some are searching for an object, others are navigating a complex maze. They can&amp;rsquo;t see what their teammates see, and they can&amp;rsquo;t shout instructions across the field. This is the challenge of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), where coordination is key but communication is often an afterthought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditional MARL often faces a major hurdle: partial observability. Each agent only sees a small part of the environment, making it difficult to make globally optimal decisions. Another problem is non-stationarity, where the environment is constantly changing due to the actions of other agents. But what if we could teach these agents to talk to each other? Thatâ€™s where the fascinating field of multi-agent deep reinforcement learning with communication (Comm-MADRL) comes in.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
